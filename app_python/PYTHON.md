## Best Practices Applied in the Development of `app_python`

In the development of `app_python`, several best practices were applied to ensure code
quality, maintainability, and scalability. Here are some of the key practices that were
followed:

### 1. Code Structure

- **Modularization**: The application's code was organized into modules and packages to
  promote code reusability and maintainability.

- **Separation of Concerns**: The code followed the principle of separation of concerns,
  with clear distinctions between routing, business logic, and presentation layers.

### 2. Virtual Environment

- **Virtual Environment**: A Python virtual environment (`venv`) was used to isolate
  project dependencies, preventing conflicts with system-wide packages.

### 3. Dependency Management

- **Requirements File**: A `requirements.txt` file was used to specify project
  dependencies, making it easy to recreate the environment in other locations.

### 4. Linters and pre-commit hooks

- Python Linters: Black and Flake8 were used to enforce code formatting and style
  guidelines for Python code. They are runs automatically by pre-commit hooks

- Markdown Linters: Prettier and markdownlint-cli were used to format and lint Markdown
  files, ensuring consistent documentation quality.

### 5. Documentation

- **README**: A comprehensive README.md file was created to provide project overview,
  setup instructions, and usage guidelines for developers and users.


### 6. Tests

- Manual test: Update the page and compare a time in Moscow with time provided by application

## Choice of Framework: Flask

### Pros

1. **Lightweight**: Flask is a lightweight micro-framework that doesn't impose many
   constraints on how you structure your application. This flexibility allows developers
   to choose their tools and libraries.

2. **Extensible**: Flask provides the foundation for building web applications and
   allows developers to choose and integrate specific libraries and extensions as
   needed. This extensibility makes it suitable for various use cases.

3. **Widely Adopted**: Flask is a popular framework with a large and active community.
   This means there are plenty of resources, extensions, and tutorials available for
   developers.

4. **Easy to Learn**: Flask's simplicity and minimalistic design make it relatively easy
   for developers, especially beginners, to learn and get started with web development
   in Python.

5. **RESTful API Support**: Flask is well-suited for building RESTful APIs, making it a
   great choice for building web services.

### Cons

1. **Minimal Features**: While Flask's minimalistic design is a pro for some, it can be
   a con for those looking for a more feature-rich framework. Developers may need to
   integrate additional libraries for features like authentication, ORM, and form
   handling.

2. **Configuration**: Flask leaves much of the configuration up to the developer, which
   can lead to inconsistencies and a steeper learning curve for beginners.

3. **Scalability**: While Flask can handle small to medium-sized applications well, it
   may require additional effort to scale up for larger, more complex projects.

4. **Opinionated Choices**: Flask's lack of strong opinions can be both an advantage and
   a disadvantage. Developers need to make many choices regarding project structure and
   tooling, which can lead to variability in codebases.

In summary, Flask was chosen for `app_python` due to its lightweight and flexible
nature, making it a suitable choice for building a simple web application. However,
developers should carefully consider their project requirements and goals when selecting
a framework, as Flask's minimalistic approach may not be the best fit for all projects.
